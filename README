The black-oil model is a simplified compositional model for describing multiphase flow with mass interchange between phases in a porous medium. It can predict compressibility and mass transfer effects, and can be used to model a low-volatility oil system, consisting mainly of methane and heavy components, using data from a conventional differential vaporization test on reservoir oil samples.
This program is composed by C++ and use Eigen mathematical library.
